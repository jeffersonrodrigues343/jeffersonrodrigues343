## Hello, I'm Jefferson
I'm a student of *Systems Analysis and Development*, currently strengthening the foundations that will make me a junior developer.

- Driven by curiosity to understand the logic behind code and transform it into something useful and beautiful.
- Learning is building, making mistakes, and debugging.
