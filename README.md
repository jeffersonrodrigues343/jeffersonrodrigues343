 # Hello, I'm Jefferson 

   I'm a student of *Systems Analysis and Development*, currently strengthening the foundations that will make me a junior developer.<br>

- Driven by curiosity to understand the logic behind code and transform it into something useful and beautiful.<br>
  
- Learning is building, making mistakes, and debugging. <br>
